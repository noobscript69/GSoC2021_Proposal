# Monte Carlo Integration
The goal of this project is to extent VolEstiâ€™s functionality to handle multi-dimensional integrals. Under this project we are targeting to provide efficient implementations for various geometric random walk algorithms to sample points from convex polytopes and volume computation in high dimensions. In particular I have to implement a more advanced Monte Carlo Integration .
